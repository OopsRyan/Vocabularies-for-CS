Vocabularies for CS

I record new words from materials about computer science. 
If you are reading this word list, I hope you can collect new words by yourself. 
In this way, I am sure you are able to remember new words more effectively than learning my copy by rote.
I actually prefer to record new words in Evernote, which can be more convenient for me, but I will push this once a week.

All right, here we go ~
